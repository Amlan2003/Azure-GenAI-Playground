# Azure GenAI Playground 🚀

Welcome to my Azure GenAI Playground! This repository showcases three exciting projects exploring different facets of generative AI using Azure's powerful models.

## Projects

### 1. Text Completion with Llama 3 🦙

A simple yet effective demonstration of text completion using the Llama 3 model. Perfect for understanding the basics of large language models.

- Invokes Llama 3 for text generation
- Demonstrates basic prompt-response interactions
- Explores model parameters and their effects

### 2. Dialogue Summarization with PEFT 📚

This project focuses on prompt engineering and model fine-tuning to summarize dialogues efficiently.

- Uses the SAMSum dataset from Hugging Face
- Implements prompt engineering techniques for better summarization
- Applies Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for improved performance
- Compares results before and after fine-tuning

### 3. RAG application using LLaMa and OpenAI ✨🤖

Dive into the world of AI-generated images using Azure OpenAI model like gpt4 and opensource model like LLaMa

- Upload your pdf file(s)
- Ask questions on these files
- Get better answers from these

### 3. Image generation with OpenAI's Dalle3 the flagship model 🎨🖌️

Use OpenAI's flagship test to image generation model Dalle3 on azure OpenAI

- Generates images from text descriptions
- Explores various prompting techniques for diverse results
- Demonstrates image editing and manipulation capabilities
